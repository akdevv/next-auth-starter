# ⏱️ Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is like a bouncer at a club who controls how many people can enter at once. It protects our app from being overwhelmed!

## 🤔 What Is Rate Limiting?

### Simple Explanation
Rate limiting **controls how many requests** a user can make in a certain time period, preventing abuse and attacks.

### Real-World Analogy
```
Rate Limiting = ATM Withdrawal Limits
├── Daily Limit ($500/day)
├── Transaction Limit (3 attempts)
├── Cooling Period (24 hours)
└── Security Alert (suspicious activity)
```

## 🚨 What We're Protecting Against

### Common Attacks
- **Brute Force**: Trying thousands of passwords
- **DDoS**: Overwhelming our servers with requests
- **Spam**: Sending too many emails or messages
- **API Abuse**: Making excessive API calls

### Real Attack Example
```
Normal User: 5 login attempts per minute ✅
Attacker: 1000 login attempts per minute ❌
```

## 🛡️ How Rate Limiting Works

### Basic Concept
1. **Count requests** from each user/IP
2. **Set time windows** (per minute, hour, day)
3. **Define limits** (max 10 requests per minute)
4. **Block excess** requests temporarily
5. **Reset counters** after time window

### Implementation Example
```ts
// Login rate limiting
const rateLimiter = {
  maxAttempts: 5,
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  blockDuration: 30 * 60 * 1000 // 30 minutes
};
```

## 🔐 In This Codebase

### Protected Endpoints
- **Login attempts**: 5 tries per 15 minutes
- **Password reset**: 3 requests per hour
- **Email verification**: 2 sends per 10 minutes
- **2FA attempts**: 10 tries per 5 minutes

### Smart Rate Limiting
- **IP-based**: Track by IP address
- **User-based**: Track by user account
- **Progressive delays**: Longer delays after each attempt
- **Whitelist**: Trusted IPs bypass limits

## 📊 Rate Limiting Strategies

### Different Approaches
- **Fixed Window**: Reset every hour exactly
- **Sliding Window**: Rolling time period
- **Token Bucket**: Earn tokens over time
- **Leaky Bucket**: Steady processing rate

### Our Approach
```ts
// We use sliding window for fairness
if (requests > limit) {
  return error("Too many requests, try again later");
}
```

## ✅ Benefits for Everyone

### For Users
- **Fair access**: Everyone gets equal opportunity
- **Better performance**: Servers stay responsive
- **Account protection**: Harder to brute force passwords

### For Our App
- **Cost control**: Prevents expensive server overload
- **Stability**: Maintains consistent performance
- **Security**: Blocks malicious automated attacks
