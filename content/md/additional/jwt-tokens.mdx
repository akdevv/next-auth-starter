# 🎫 JWT Tokens

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a secure way to transmit information between parties. Think of them like a digital passport that proves who you are.

## 🤔 What Are JWT Tokens?

### Simple Explanation
A JWT is like a **secure note** that contains:
- **Who you are** (your user ID)
- **When it was created** (timestamp)
- **When it expires** (expiration date)
- **A signature** to prove it's authentic

### Real-World Analogy
```
JWT = Concert Ticket
├── Your Name (who)
├── Event Date (when)
├── Seat Number (permissions)
└── Security Hologram (signature)
```

## 🏗️ How They Work

### Three Parts
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiIxMjMifQ.signature
     ↑ Header    ↑ Payload    ↑ Signature
```

1. **Header**: Says "this is a JWT token"
2. **Payload**: Contains your user information
3. **Signature**: Proves nobody tampered with it

## 🔐 In This Codebase

### Session Tokens
Instead of traditional JWTs, we use **session tokens**:
- Stored in secure cookies
- Reference database sessions
- More secure for web applications

### Why Session Tokens?
- **Revokable**: Can instantly logout users
- **Stateful**: Track user activity and devices
- **Secure**: Harder to steal than JWTs

## ✅ Key Benefits

- **Stateless**: Server doesn't need to remember anything
- **Portable**: Work across different services
- **Secure**: Cryptographically signed and verified
- **Efficient**: Lightweight and fast to process
