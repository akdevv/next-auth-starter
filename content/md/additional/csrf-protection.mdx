# 🛡️ CSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is like someone forging your signature to access your bank account. Let's learn how we protect against it!

## 🤔 What Is CSRF?

### Simple Explanation
CSRF happens when a **malicious website** tricks your browser into making requests to our app **using your logged-in session**.

### Real-World Analogy
```
CSRF Attack = Forged Check
├── Your Bank Account (Our App)
├── Signed Blank Check (Your Session)
├── Malicious Person (Bad Website)
└── Unauthorized Purchase (Harmful Action)
```

## 😈 How CSRF Attacks Work

### The Attack Scenario
1. **You login** to our banking app
2. **You visit** a malicious website (in another tab)
3. **The bad site** has hidden forms targeting our app
4. **Your browser** automatically sends your cookies
5. **Our app** thinks the request came from you
6. **Money gets transferred** without your knowledge!

## 🛡️ How We Protect You

### CSRF Tokens
```html
<!-- Every form gets a secret token -->
<form>
  <input type="hidden" name="csrfToken" value="abc123xyz">
  <button type="submit">Transfer Money</button>
</form>
```

### The Protection Process
1. **We generate** a random secret token
2. **We embed** it in every form
3. **You submit** the form with the token
4. **We verify** the token matches our records
5. **If valid**, we process the request
6. **If missing/wrong**, we reject it

## 🔐 In This Codebase

### NextAuth CSRF Protection
- **Automatic tokens**: NextAuth handles CSRF tokens for us
- **State parameters**: OAuth flows include state verification
- **Secure cookies**: Session cookies have CSRF protection built-in

### Form Protection
```ts
// Forms automatically include CSRF tokens
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('csrfToken', await getCsrfToken());
```

## 🚫 What CSRF Can't Do

### Limitations of Attacks
- **Can't read responses**: Only send requests, not read results
- **Can't steal tokens**: Tokens are hidden from malicious sites
- **Can't bypass CORS**: Cross-origin restrictions still apply

## ✅ Protection Benefits

- **Invisible security**: Works without user interaction
- **Automatic defense**: Built into our authentication system
- **Industry standard**: Proven protection method
- **Zero maintenance**: No additional user setup required
