# üîê Password Hashing

Passwords are never stored in plain text. Our system uses industry-standard hashing algorithms to ensure user credentials remain secure even in the event of a data breach.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Implementation

### Hashing Algorithm
- **bcrypt**: Industry-standard password hashing function
- **Salt rounds**: Configurable cost factor for computational difficulty
- **Rainbow table protection**: Unique salt for each password

### Storage Security
```ts
// Passwords are hashed before storage
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, saltRounds);
```

## üîß Key Features

### Adaptive Security
- **Configurable rounds**: Adjust hashing cost as hardware improves
- **Future-proof**: Algorithm can be upgraded without user intervention
- **Performance balance**: Secure but not prohibitively slow

### Password Validation
- **Timing attack protection**: Consistent verification time
- **Hash comparison**: Secure comparison using bcrypt.compare()
- **No plaintext exposure**: Original passwords never logged or stored

## üìä Security Benefits

### Protection Against
- **Data breaches**: Hashed passwords are computationally infeasible to reverse
- **Rainbow tables**: Unique salts prevent precomputed attack tables
- **Brute force**: High computational cost deters systematic attacks

### Compliance
- **Industry standards**: Follows OWASP password storage guidelines
- **Regulatory compliance**: Meets data protection requirements
- **Security audits**: Transparent and auditable implementation

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- **Never store plaintext**: All passwords immediately hashed upon receipt
- **Secure transmission**: HTTPS ensures passwords aren't intercepted
- **Memory safety**: Sensitive data cleared from memory after use
- **Audit logging**: Password change events logged for security monitoring
