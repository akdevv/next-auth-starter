# 🔐 Session Security

Our session management system provides comprehensive tracking, monitoring, and security controls to protect user accounts from unauthorized access.

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Session Tracking
```ts
// Get all user sessions with security details
const sessions = await getUserSessions();
// Returns: device, location, IP, activity, creation time
```

### Device Monitoring
- **Device identification**: Track device names and user agents
- **Location tracking**: IP-based geographical location detection
- **Activity monitoring**: Real-time last active timestamps

## 🔍 Monitoring Capabilities

### Real-time Tracking
- **Current session**: Identify which device user is currently on
- **Active sessions**: Monitor all active login sessions
- **Session history**: Complete audit trail of login activity

### Security Dashboard
```ts
return sessions.map(session => ({
  deviceName: session.deviceName,
  location: session.location,
  lastActive: session.lastActive,
  isCurrent: session.isCurrent
}));
```

## 🚨 Security Controls

### Session Revocation
- **Manual termination**: Users can revoke any session remotely
