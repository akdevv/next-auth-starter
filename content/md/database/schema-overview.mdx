# 📊 Database Schema Overview

The authentication system uses a PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM, designed for scalability and security. The schema consists of 6 core models that handle all authentication and user management features.

## 🏗️ Core Models

### 👤 User Model
Central entity storing user information, authentication settings, and security preferences.

### 🔐 Session Model  
Manages active user sessions with device tracking and security monitoring.

### 🔗 Account Model
Handles OAuth provider connections (Google, GitHub, etc.) for social authentication.

### ✉️ Verification Models
- **VerificationToken**: Email verification and password reset tokens
- **VerificationAttempt**: Audit trail for verification attempts

### 🛡️ Security Models
- **TwoFactorToken**: Temporary tokens for 2FA verification

## 🔄 Key Relationships

```ts
User → Sessions (1:many)
User → Accounts (1:many) 
User → VerificationAttempts (1:many)
User → TwoFactorTokens (1:many)
```

## 🎯 Design Principles

- **Security First**: All sensitive data is properly encrypted
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of authentication events
- **Scalable**: Indexed for performance with growing user base
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript integration with Prisma
