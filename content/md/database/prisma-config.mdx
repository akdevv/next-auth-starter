# ⚙️ Prisma Configuration

Prisma serves as our type-safe database client, providing seamless integration between TypeScript and PostgreSQL.

## 📁 Client Setup

The Prisma client is configured for optimal performance in both development and production environments:

```ts
// lib/prisma.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

declare global {
	var prisma: PrismaClient | undefined;
}

export const db = globalThis.prisma || new PrismaClient();

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
	globalThis.prisma = db;
}
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### Development Optimization
- **Global instance**: Prevents multiple client instances during development
- **Hot reload friendly**: Maintains connection across file changes

### Production Ready
- **Single instance**: Clean client instantiation for production
- **Connection pooling**: Efficient database connection management

## 🔧 Configuration Benefits

- **Type Safety**: Auto-generated types for all database operations
- **Query Builder**: Intuitive API for complex database queries
- **Migration System**: Version-controlled database schema changes
- **Performance**: Built-in query optimization and caching

## 📝 Usage

Import the database client anywhere in your application:

```ts
import { db } from "@/lib/prisma";

const user = await db.user.findUnique({
  where: { email: "user@example.com" }
});
```
